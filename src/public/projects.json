      "description": "Merlin Entertainment Group runs some great theme parks in the UK. As a frequent patron of these establishments, I found myself frustrated by the usability of their hotel booking website. The site only allows you to see the price for one date at a time.\n\nI decided to scrape the data (using PHP), cache it in a MySQL database and then display it, all at once, in a calendar spanning the whole year.\n\nThe front end makes use of the React framework for rendering, and the flux pattern to keep track of the data. You can select the hotel you want to see prices for, and the number of nights you want to stay."

      "description": "A simple Roulette game made with Unity. There is no server integration, and the results are no pre calculated. The wheel undergoes a real physics simulation and the result is determined by detecthing which pocket the ball lands in. The game was designed to be sold as a standalone template project to be included as a mini game in other Unity projects, via the asset store.\n\nThe physics driven results (as opposed to predetermined) were chosen because the client's budget was tight, so the game needed to be completed in just a few days. Despite this extremely tight deadline, the game still features all the standard roulette betting options and includes a different layout for desktop and mobile in order to efficiently make use of the available screen real estate."

It was really great, but there were a lack of VR experiences out there at the time.\n\nI put together a VR tetris game in Unity which came out pretty well. You could navigate the menus using the magnet button on the Google Cardboard, and the Tetris blocks would follow wherever you were looking, leading to an intuitive and immersive experience."
